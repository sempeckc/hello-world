GitHub Tutorial

Hello World,

I am sempeckc and I am very interested in becoming a freelance data analyst slash bioinformatician slash machine learning developer. I'm trying to use GitHub to gain experience and publish some of my data analysis portfolio. Maybe one day I'll even move my CRISPR gRNA development software here for people to use!
